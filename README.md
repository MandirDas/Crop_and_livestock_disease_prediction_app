# 1. Introduction
The Crop and Livestock Disease Recognition Mobile App is an innovative solution designed for both iOS and Android platforms. It aims to help users identify diseases based on symptoms or images, providing potential causes and treatments using advanced machine learning and AI technologies.
# 2. Features

Disease recognition through symptom input
Disease recognition through image upload
Integration with ML model for image analysis
Integration with Gemini AI for disease information and treatment suggestions
Cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)

# 3. Technical Architecture
[Screenshot: High-level architecture diagram]
The app's architecture consists of the following components:

Frontend: Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
Backend: Python with Flask framework
Server: Render for hosting the backend
Machine Learning: TensorFlow for image processing and disease recognition
AI Integration: Google's Gemini AI API for disease information and treatment suggestions
Database: Firebase (planned for future implementation)

# 4. User Flow

User opens the app
User chooses input method (symptoms or image)
If symptoms:

User inputs symptoms
App processes symptoms and suggests possible diseases


If image:

User uploads an image
ML model processes the image and identifies the disease


App displays recognized disease with confidence score
Gemini AI provides additional information on causes and treatments
User views results and can save or share the information
